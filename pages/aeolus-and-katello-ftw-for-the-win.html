    <h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Recent years have seen an influx of Cloud Computing services offered by
a plethora of vendors with many different APIs and interfaces. The
diversity of these products offer many solutions at various levels of
the stack, but increases the risk of proprietary cloud adoption due to
vendor lock-in and downtime.
With Aeolus we aim to provide a Free and Open Source cloud computing
framework through which instances can be launched against any cloud provider
using the same API and toolset.  The infrastructure permits the
description of software services and hardware components in such a way
that any set of software packages can be deployed to any cloud provider
matching specified criteria.
With Katello, we For Katello i will show how to manage running instances,
apply errata, do updates, compare status with deployed images,
manage content effectively.
All of this to simplify the life of sysadmins and devops.</p>
<h2 id="speaker">Speaker</h2>
<p>n addition to being the official main front person for Aeolus in the EU,
I'm a Ruby Software Engineer on Aeolus and the Deltacloud project (also Apache
licensed),
with a background as a sysadmin.</p>
<p>I've developed many webapps beginning with mod_perl and php, and crossed
the river of object oriented programming with Python at first, after Ruby,
Rails and Sinatra, where I found my real happiness.
I'm a LILIK Member (Florence University association for the spread of open
source)
and as member I'm involved to the creation of events with Open source and
Linux/BSD topics.
Functional languages lover (Clojure as first).
I actively contribute in multiple gems and openshift "redis-openshift".
I give my 2 cents on opensource knowledge with my presence on the ruby,
openbsd misc mailing lists and as a salutary patcher on the pdfcube project.</p>
