    <h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Cloud and Virtualised Infrastructure rely on machine instances as the
user facing platform. However, this very machine instance is one of
the hardest and trickiest resource to provision out of traditional
operating systems. Being able to do so consistently across multiple
vendor requirements, site requirements and environment requirements
usually involves either relying on a third party built instance, a
vendor purpose built  - and often slow releasing - instance or having
to setup large infrastructure inhouse.</p>
<p>Looking to solve this problem we came up with project raindrops. This
aims to resolve some of the issues and bridge the traditional
deploymnet roles ( eg. kickstarts ) with cloud and virtualised
infrastructure requirements ( eg. static images ); At the head of the
problem space we are trying to solve is the idea that a single
defition of the required machine instance should be consumeable in
multiple environments like on-laptop KVM / Vmware / Vagrant as well as
incloud environments like OpenStack, CloudStack, OpenNebula,
Eucalyptus as well as public on-demand environments like AWS, Dell
Cloud, HPCloud etc.</p>
<p>In this talk, I will expand on the problem space and propose some
solutions, as well as demonstrate a unified ( git, web and rest )
interface to instance provisioning across multiple vendors and
environments. By the end of this talk attendees should have a good
understanding of how they can integrate instance building into
existing CI and CD platforms, without needing the infrastructure
needed to stay vendor agnostic.</p>
